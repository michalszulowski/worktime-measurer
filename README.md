# Worktime Measurer
The application storing you work time and activities. Counts time statistics and motivates.

## Main goal
The main goal of this project was not to develop numerous functionalities, especially it was not created to make the UI look pretty. This app is a demonstration of my style of writing code. I have put a lot of effort to make the code clean and extensible. I also tried to use a few new technologies. 

### Selected elements
- Serialization of objects with collections to JSON with GSON library
- Unit test with JUnit
- Usage of my other project as external dependencies
- Usage of Lombok
- Added support for usage of different languages

## Usage example 
Example of adding activity

![Usage example 1](examples/example_1.png?raw=true "Example")

![Usage example 1](examples/example_2.png?raw=true "Example")

## Further plans 
My nearest goal is to implement a server for storing user's work records.
